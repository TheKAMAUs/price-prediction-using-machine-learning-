Airbnb Booking Price Prediction Project
Problem Statement
In the world of vacation rentals, pricing your property correctly on platforms like Airbnb is crucial. Underpricing can lead to lost revenue, while overpricing may deter potential guests. Therefore, developing an accurate pricing model is essential for both hosts and guests alike.

The objective of this project is to create a predictive model that can estimate booking prices for Airbnb listings. To achieve this goal, we will explore and compare two popular regression techniques: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression. We want to see which model performs better and why.

By the end of this project, we aim to answer the question: "Between Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression, which model performs better in predicting Airbnb booking prices and why?" The insights gained from this analysis will not only assist Airbnb hosts in pricing their listings accurately but also provide valuable knowledge about the factors affecting booking prices in the short-term rental market.

Linear Regression
Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (in this case, Airbnb booking prices) and one or more independent variables (features or predictors). It assumes a linear relationship between the variables and aims to find the best-fit line that minimizes the sum of squared differences between observed and predicted values. This model is simple to understand and interpret but may not capture complex, non-linear relationships in the data.

Random Forest Regression
Random Forest Regression is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to make more accurate predictions. Each tree in the forest is built on a random subset of the data and a random subset of features. The final prediction is an average (for regression) or a majority vote (for classification) of the predictions from individual trees. Random Forest models are known for their flexibility, ability to handle non-linear relationships, and resistance to overfitting.

Data
To build and evaluate our predictive models, we will utilize a dataset from kaggle of New York containing historical Airbnb booking information. The dataset includes various features such as 'id', 'name', 'host_id', 'host_name', 'neighbourhood_group','neighbourhood', 'latitude', 'longitude', 'room_type', 'price', 'minimum_nights', 'number_of_reviews', 'last_review' 'reviews_per_month', 'calculated_host_listings_count', 'availability_365'; which can potentially influence booking prices. We split the dataset into training and testing sets to assess the model's performance accurately.

Methodology
We followed these steps for our project:

Data Preprocessing (EDA): Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features as necessary.

Feature Selection: Identify relevant features that may impact booking prices. We will use domain knowledge and statistical methods to select the most important predictors.

Model Selection: Implement both Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression models. Tune hyperparameters for the Random Forest model to optimize performance.

Model Training: Train the selected models on the training dataset.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) on the testing dataset.

Comparison: Compare the performance of the Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression models to determine which one provides better predictions for Airbnb booking prices.
